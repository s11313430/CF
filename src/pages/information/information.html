      Most people who have CF also have a condition known as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), which means that the important digestive enzymes in the pancreas cannot reach the intestines to aid in the digestion of important nutrients such as fat, carbohydrates
      and protein. If these nutrients are not digested, all of the vitamins and minerals that are in them will not be absorbed into the body. In order for people who have EPI due to CF to digest and absorb the nutrients in food, they need to take supplemental
      pancreatic enzymes.

    <p style="color:#8B2E2E;">
      To get enough calories to promote normal weight gain and growth, individuals with CF may need to consume up to two times as many calories as a person without the disease. Also, to be sure that the correct amounts of vitamins are available, a multivitamin
      designed for people who have CF is usually prescribed.

      Even though people who have CF need extra calories, this does not mean people with CF can eat foods like french fries covered in cheese as their only food at every meal! They need to balance food intake at meals and snacks to stay on track with weight
      gain, growth and overall healthy nutrition.
